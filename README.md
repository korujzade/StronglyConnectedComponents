# Strongly Connected Components
Implementation of Tarjan Algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in Directed Graph.

Graph is represented in graph.gx file. The number of nodes, name of each node and edges of each node should be declined
in different lines. Please see graph.gx as an example.

I have used stack-array library developed by Berkeley University. You can find link below:
